# Chou-Fasman

Python implementation of Chou-Fasman algorithm for protein secondary structure prediction.

Chou-Fasman algorithm was the first protein structure prediction algorithm developed by Chou and Fasman in 1974. It pioneered a series of developments in protein structure prediction. This algorithm is based on a propensity table that was constructed by examining the x-ray-determined structures of 15 proteins containing 2473 amino acid residues and the number of occurrences of a given amino acid in the alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and coil was tabulated. The algorithm uses the propensity table and the set of empirical rules formulated by Chou and Fasman for protein secondary structure prediction.
