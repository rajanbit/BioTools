# Seq-Logo

Python implementation for creating nucleotide and amino acid sequence logo from multi fasta file

## Requirements:
>OS Linux

>Python 3.7.4

>Matplotlib

## sequence_logo_nt.py
This script takes multi fasta file with DNA sequences of same length as input and create nucleotides sequence logo

![nt_sequence_logo](https://github.com/rajanbit/BioTools/blob/main/Seq-Logo/images/nt_seq_logo.png)

```
$ python sequence_logo_nt.py <multi.fasta>
```

## sequence_logo_aa.py 
This script takes multi fasta file with protein sequences of same length as input and create amino acids sequence logo

![aa_sequence_logo](https://github.com/rajanbit/BioTools/blob/main/Seq-Logo/images/aa_seq_logo.png)

```
$ python sequence_logo_aa.py <multi.fasta>
```
